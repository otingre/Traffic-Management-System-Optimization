#Traffic-Management-System-Optimization

Optimizes the installation of the minimum number of security cameras required at traffic intersections based on the vertex cover problem.

• a1: python code which takes as input street names along with their coordinates and outputs a graph with the optimized vertices and edges (based on the vertex cover problem)

• a2: c++ code which takes as input a number of vertices, the indices of the edges, and a pair of points, and outputs the shortest path between that pair of points

• rgen: c++ code which randomly generates inputs for a1, excluding some special cases which the program cannot process (ex, self loops, one street intersecting with itself)

• a3: c++ code which uses fork and pipe functionality to combine them all together
